# SpaceShooter

## Description
It's an endless shooter where you gain score points after killing an enemy. 
The enemies move in one direction and shoot down while spawning in random locations.
There are 2 upgrades that the player can pick up.
The first gives a shield that protects the player from one shot of an enemy bullet, but you can only pick up the shield again after getting hit by the enemy. 
The second upgrade gives the player orb that rotates around the player and shoots randomly, and you can stack as many of them as you please.
